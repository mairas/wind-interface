# NMEA0183 Wind Instrument Interface

This project provides a configuration interface and NMEA 2000 as well as
Signal K connectivity for
an Autonnic A5120 wind instrument. All documented configuration messages are
supported.

To build, clone the repository and build and upload in PlatformIO. The project
assumes SH-ESP32 hardware with two additional RS485 interface modules for
bidirectional NMEA0183 communication.
